## Ergonomics

### Syntax Highlighting
Installing a lit-html syntax highlighting plugin to your editor will highlight the syntax just like JSX is highlighted. One for VSCode is here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html

A styled-components syntax highlighting plugin will add syntax highlighting to the css tagged template literals. An example VSCode plugin is here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=styled-components.vscode-styled-components
